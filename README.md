# parkingApp

##About
This simple webapp displays the free spots left in most public parking garages in Muenster, Germany. It also shows the user (with HTML5 geolocation) which spot is closest to him and he can sort by distance and free spots left. The different parking garages are color-coded depending on the free spots left.

##Technology

parkingApp uses AngularJS and Bootstrap. The data is provided by the [Code for Muenster parking api](http://codeformuenster.org/parkleitsystem-api/).

##Demo

Check out the demo over [here](http://c0dr.github.io/parkingApp). 

##Installation

Simply clone and use a http server to serve it (doesn't work from file:// because the data is fetched via CORS).


##License

This application is licensed under MIT, the data however is licensed under different licenses. Check out the api for more information.
